```terminal
$ python setup.py install
```

You may need to run the above commands with `sudo`.

## Getting Started

Getting started with the Hoiio API couldn't be easier. Create a HoiioRestClient and you're ready to go.

### API Credential

The HoiioRestClient needs your Hoiio credentials. You can either pass these directly to the constructor (see the code below) or via environment variables.

```python
from hoiio.rest import HoiioRestClient

appid = 'YOUR_APPID_HERE'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
client = HoiioRestClient(appid, token)
```

### Make a call

```python
from hoiio.rest import HoiioRestClient

appid = 'YOUR_APPID_HERE'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
client = HoiioRestClient(appid, token)

resp = client.voice.call(params={ 'dest':'+6512345678', 'dest2':'+6554326547', 'caller_id':'Mickey Cheong' })
```


### Send a sms

```python
from hoiio.rest import HoiioRestClient

appid = 'YOUR_APPID_HERE'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
client = HoiioRestClient(appid, token)

resp = client.sms.send({ 'dest':'+6565123476', 'msg':'Hello, Mickey' })
```

### Subcribe a number

```python
from hoiio.rest import HoiioRestClient

appid = 'YOUR_APPID_HERE'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
client = HoiioRestClient(appid, token)

resp = client.number.subscribe({ 'number':'+6567589405', 'duration':60 })
```

### Get account balance

```python
from hoiio.rest import HoiioRestClient

appid = 'YOUR_APPID_HERE'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
client = HoiioRestClient(appid, token)

resp = client.account.balance()
```

### Dial a number

```python
from hoiio.rest import HoiioRestClient

appid = 'YOUR_APPID_HERE'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
client = HoiioRestClient(appid, token)

resp = client.ivr.dial(params={ 'dest': '+6599238829', \
                                'msg': '<speech language="en" gender="male">Hello World</speech>' })
```


### New APIs added by samwize

```python
# Send bulk SMS
resp = client.sms.bulk_send({ 'dest':'+6511111111,+6522222222', 'msg':'Hello, Mickey' })

# Get countries which has Hoiio local numbers
resp = client.number.get_countries()

# Pretty print it
import simplejson as json
d = json.loads(resp)
import pprint
pprint.pprint(d)

# Fax 
resp = client.fax.send('fax.pdf', { 'dest':'+6567473246'})
resp = client.fax.get_history()
resp = client.fax.get_rate({ 'dest':'+6511111111', 'incoming':'+6500000000'})
resp = client.fax.query_status({ 'txn_ref':'AA-1234'})

```
